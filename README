Notes:
1. These scripts are designed to be used with python3 and will NOT work with python2.   
2. The programs donot take command line arguments hence the server ip address has to be entered into the script manually.
3. The server script assumes that it has maxClient no. of sockets free consecutively starting from serverPortBase
4. The "server exit" command is broken for the multi-threaded version of the scripts
5. project1_bak contains the basic version of the scripts but only support 1 client per server. Usage instructions for them is the same as the multi-threaded version.
6. The maximum number of supported clients can be specified by modifying the maxClient variable (default set to 5)
7. The current multi-threading implementation is very crude, inefficient and not secure 

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
1. ./TCPServer.py  #assumes that /usr/bin/python points to python3 binary
    or run "python3 TCPServer.py"
2. ./TCPClient.py  or "python3 TCPClient.py"
3. enter multiple commands as you wish. To see a list of supported commands type "help"
4. to exit client type "quit"
5. you can try using the client script from multiple machines but the sever ip has to be specified( default is localhost)
